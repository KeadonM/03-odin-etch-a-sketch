# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a simple pixel art drawing app developed to practice the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first project which dealt with DOM manipulation.

I deviated slightly from the initial project which was meant to more closely mimic an Etch-a-Sketch.

This was an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) from The Odin Project.

## Questions looking back on this project.

### What could be better?

- Some variables and functions could be named better.
- The code would benefit from a few comments.
- To me the CSS seems a little messy.
- Firefox support.

### What was most challenging?

Figuring out how to handle different drawing modes. As I added more functionality I had to refactor how I handled drawing modes as the initial solution was too messy.
